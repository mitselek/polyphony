# Polyphony

**A platform for choral music sharing.**

Polyphony empowers choirs to manage their sheet music privately while connecting with other choirs through a trusted network. No paywalls, no central control—your music library belongs to you.

## Production Status

**Vault:** [![Vault Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/vault-live-brightgreen?logo=cloudflare&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://crede.polyphony.uk) `crede.polyphony.uk`  
**Registry:** [![Registry Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/registry-live-brightgreen?logo=cloudflare&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://polyphony.uk) `polyphony.uk`

_First production deployment: Kammerkoor Crede (Feb 2026)_

## The Problem

Choirs today face a difficult choice:

- **Paid platforms** (IMSLP Pro, ChoralWiki premium) charge subscriptions and control your library
- **Informal sharing** (email, Dropbox) lacks organization and raises legal concerns
- **No good solution** for sharing rehearsal materials between choirs you trust

## The Solution

Polyphony is a **two-tier system**:

### 🏠 The Vault

A single deployment hosting all choir organizations.

- Upload and organize PDF scores
- Invite choir members with role-based access
- Your organization's data stays organized and secure
- Support for umbrella organizations (e.g., Estonian Choral Association)

### 🌐 The Registry

A zero-storage auth gateway and discovery service.

- Register your organization at `polyphony.uk/register`
- Discover other choirs and browse Public Domain scores
- Single sign-on across all organizations (SSO cookie)
- No storage of user or score data—queries Vault APIs at runtime

## How It Works

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          REGISTRY (polyphony.uk)                 │
│   • Auth (OAuth, SSO)  • Directory  • PD Catalog │
│   • Zero storage - queries Vault APIs            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
              Queries public APIs
                        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          VAULT (*.polyphony.uk)                  │
│   • Single deployment, all organizations         │
│   • Scores, members, events, participation       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
              Subdomain routing
        ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐

   (collective)     (collective)    (umbrella)
```

1. **Register your organization** via the Registry (`polyphony.uk/register`)
2. **Upload scores** to your organization's library
3. **Invite members** by email—they log in via Registry SSO
4. **Access multiple orgs** with one account (SSO across subdomains)

## Legal Design

Polyphony is built with legal safety in mind:

- **Organization Responsibility**: Each choir controls and is responsible for their content
- **Registry Neutrality**: The Registry stores no files—queries Vault APIs for directory and PD catalog
- **Takedown Support**: Built-in copyright complaint mechanism
- **Private Circle** _(future)_: Planned sharing between trusted organizations follows EU "private use" guidelines

For full details, see [docs/LEGAL-FRAMEWORK.md](docs/LEGAL-FRAMEWORK.md).

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for your jurisdiction.
