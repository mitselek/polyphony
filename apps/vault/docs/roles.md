# Vault Roles

Polyphony vaults use role-based access control (RBAC). **Members can have multiple roles.** Roles are **non-hierarchical** — each role grants specific permissions without inheriting from others.

A member's effective permissions are the **union** of all their roles' permissions.

**Note:** Being an authenticated member implicitly grants "singer" permissions (view/download scores). The explicit roles below grant _additional_ capabilities.

## Assignable Roles

### Owner

The vault owner manages governance and membership, but **not operational tasks** (scores, events). Owners can assign themselves operational roles as needed.

**Responsibilities:**

- Vault deployment and infrastructure decisions
- Inter-vault trust relationships (federation)
- Appointing admins, librarians, conductors and other roles
- Member management and role assignments

**Permissions:**

- `members:invite` - Send membership invitations
- `members:manage` - Change member roles, remove members
- `vault:delete` - Delete the entire vault
- `federation:manage` - Manage inter-vault relationships

**Constraints:**

- ⚠️ **Protected role**: At least one active owner must exist at all times
- Cannot remove your own owner role if you're the last owner
- Ownership transfer requires explicit handover

**To manage scores**: Assign yourself the `librarian` role  
**To manage events**: Assign yourself the `conductor` role

**Typical holder:** Choir board president, IT committee chair, or designated technical liaison

- `members:invite` - Send membership invitations
- `members:manage` - Change member roles, remove members (cannot assign/remove owner role)
- `takedowns:process` - Handle copyright claims

**Permissions:**

## Member Schema

Members have the following properties:

| Property     | Type     | Description                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | TEXT     | Unique identifier                             |
| `email`      | TEXT     | Email address (unique, from Registry)         |
| `name`       | TEXT     | Display name                                  |
| `invited_by` | TEXT     | Reference to inviting member                  |
| `joined_at`  | DATETIME | When member joined                            |

Roles are stored in a separate `member_roles` junction table, allowing multiple roles per member.

Voices and sections are stored in separate `member_voices` and `member_sections` junction tables (migration 0003).

## Role Assignment

### Initial Setup

When a vault is created, the first member automatically becomes **owner**.

### Invitations

- Owner can assign any roles: owner, admin, librarian, conductor, section_leader
- Admin can assign any roles except owner: admin, librarian, conductor, section_leader

### Role Changes

- Owners can add/remove any role from any member
- Admins can add/remove any role except owner from any member
- Cannot remove your own owner role if you're the last owner

### Common Role Combinations

| Combination            | Use Case                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| owner                  | Board member focused on governance only                      |
| owner + admin          | Board chair who also manages daily operations                |
| owner + librarian      | Owner who also curates the score library                     |
| admin + librarian      | Choir manager handling both members and scores               |
| conductor + librarian  | Conductor who also maintains the music library               |
| admin + conductor      | Choir director handling both membership and rehearsal events |

## Future Considerations

- **Event manager**: Future role for concert/rehearsal scheduling
- **Role expiry**: Time-limited elevated roles (e.g., guest librarian for a project)
- **Audit log**: Track role changes for accountability
- **Custom roles**: Allow vaults to define their own roles with custom permission sets
